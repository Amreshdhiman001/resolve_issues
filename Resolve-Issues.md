# Resolve Issues Collaboratively

step 1: Identify the Issue
  Users have reported slow system performance, impacting their overall experience.
step 2: Collaborate with Users and Team
  1. Schedule a meeting with users and the development team to discuss the performance issue.
  2. Collect specific examples from users about when they experienced slow performance.

step 3: Use Fishbone Diagram
 As a collaborative exercise, create a Fishbone Diagram on a whiteboard or using a collaborative tool.
 Identify major categories contributing to the slow performance, such as hardware, network, and software.
 Hardware: Outdated server, insufficient RAM
 Network: Slow internet connection, network congestion.
 Software: Insufficient algorithms, memory leaks.
